This code dictates that he only hunts and kills other murderers who have evaded justice, presenting him as a vigilante of sorts, meting out his version of justice in the streets of Miami. Dexter's internal struggle to balance his facade as a seemingly ordinary, charming, and affable member of society with his insatiable need to kill creates an intriguing tension that captivates audiences.
